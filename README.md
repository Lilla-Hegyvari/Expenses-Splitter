# Expenses-Splitter
#This is the documentation document for project "Expenses Splitter" for the AESB2122-24 course at the TU Delft, done by student 5502926. The goal of this project is to let the user input a CVS file containing a list of expenses shared by a group of people. The expenses will then be split amongst the group as specified in the CVS file and simplified as to minimise the number of needed money transfers.

#I started this project by taking a sample CVS file. This sample CVS file was created from the list of expenses made by my three roommates and I in the last few months.
